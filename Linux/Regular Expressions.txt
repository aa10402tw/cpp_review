	Quantifier: a+(>=1), a*(>=0), a?(<=1 and >=0)
	\w: Word, \W: Not Word, \d: Digit, \D: Not Digit, \s: Whitespace, \S: Not Whitespace
	Character Set: [abc], [a-z], [a-zA-Z0-9]

	e*  : match (e) in a row as much as possible >= 0 (e.g., "" , e, ee eee)
	e+a : match (e) in a row as much as possible, followed by (a) (e.g., ea eea eeea) 
	e+a?: match (e) in a row as much as possible, followed by (a), and (a) is optional (e.g., e ea ee eea eeea) 
	(e:Character, +:Quantifier, match 0 or more, a:character, ?:Quantifier, match between 0 and 1)
	e.  : match  (e) and any character (.) except line break (use \. to match character .)

	\w match any word character (a,b,c), \W match any non-word character ("" "\t")

	\w{wordLen} match any word length L \w{min, max} match any word length between min and max
	[ak] match character in the character set (in this case, a and k)
