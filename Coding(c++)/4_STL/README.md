# STL (Standard Template Library)
The C++ STL (Standard Template Library) is a powerful set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, queues, and stacks.

## Containers
queue, stack, vector, deque, list, map, set, bitset.

## Algorithms
reverse, sort, search (find)

## Iterators
use to iterate over the elements of object (container or subset of container).
